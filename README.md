Presenting Markov Chain For Dummies (MCFD) (made by a dummy)!
This is a rudimentary attempt at teaching myself MCMC data fitting, given no one ever sat and taught me how, or taught me bayesian stats. In theory you can use this without any prior knowledge of MCMC or Bayesian stats, and all you need to is plug in your range of values the parameters could be, the model being fitted, and the data and VOILA you are on your way.
I've not had much data to test it with, outside of sythentic data and my low quality exoplanet transit data, so some *actual* testing would be appreciated, with feedback on how to improve it. 
Enjoy!
